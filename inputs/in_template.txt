PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING:

If the list is not an album, the application will attempt to parse missing metadata fields.

If the url list is an album, enter metadata below and replace "False" by "True". 
No need to repeat metadata through the list. If artist has various artists, leave "artist" field unchanged in album and amend throught the url list.
Track number will be inferred from order. 
The parser will only look at the title and artist (in case of album with numerous artists) fields.

ALBUM METADATA HERE:
album:False > album;;artist;;year

URL LIST HERE:
url;;track_number;;title;;album;;artist;;year
